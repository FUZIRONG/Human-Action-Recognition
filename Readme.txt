How to run the code:
	Open jupyter notebook and then open the file FinalCVProject.ipynb
	Download the dataset and extract it.
	Change the path in the code where your dataset is downloaded or either extract it in the same folder.
	Run the python file "create_train_test". It will make two separate folders for training and testing and the splitting is done according to split file provided in the official website of UCF101. This code was available online to split the dataset.
	Now, run the cells in the .ipynb file one by one and we are done!

Also, phase1Evaluation.ipynb contains the code we did before the first evaluation.

Another way to run the code without taking much time:
	Go to the link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CB43hwAikzUHqUREeZ6cAwdo26PtoK_l
	Download the folder named "data" and save it in your google drive.
	Open google colab and run the FinalCVProject.ipynb file.
	The folder already contains extracted features and images so it won't take much time to run.
